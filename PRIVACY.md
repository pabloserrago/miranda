# Privacy Policy

**Miranda** is built by Pablo Serrano. This policy explains what data the app collects and how it is used.

## Data Collection

Miranda collects **anonymous** usage analytics to improve the app experience. This includes:

- **Event data**: app opens, notes created, notes completed
- **Contextual data**: hour of day, day of week (no dates or timestamps tied to identity)
- **App metadata**: app version, device language

Miranda also offers an optional feedback feature that collects:

- **Feedback category**: "Request Feature" or "Report a Problem"
- **Message**: the text you write
- **App metadata**: app version, device language

## What We Do NOT Collect

- No personal information (name, email, phone, address)
- No device identifiers (IDFA, IDFV, or fingerprinting)
- No location data
- No contacts, photos, or files
- No tracking across apps or websites
- No third-party analytics SDKs (no Google Analytics, no Firebase, no Mixpanel)

## Data Storage

Anonymous analytics and feedback are stored securely using [Supabase](https://supabase.com), hosted in the cloud. No data can be traced back to an individual user.

## Notes & Content

All notes you create in Miranda are stored **locally on your device** and in a shared App Group container for the widget. Your notes are never sent to any server.

## Microphone

Miranda requests microphone access only when you use voice input to capture notes. Audio is processed by Apple's on-device dictation. Miranda does not record, store, or transmit audio.

## Third-Party Services

Miranda does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

Miranda does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Changes

This policy may be updated occasionally. Changes will be reflected on this page.
